- 👋 Hi, I’m Ritvik Shukla, an Undergrad at NIT Jalandhar pursuing Chemical Engineering and an upcoming Data Analyst
- 👀 I’m interested in world of Data Analytics and Visulatisation. Ever since I was a kid I was very fascianted by watching the so many different stats about different players and team in the IPL. 
 I always wondered how cool and amazing it would be to able tro create those stats myself and do the Visualitsation aswell and that Fascination and Interest lead me to the world of Data Analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and Machine Learning using Python
